    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h2>Chocolate Crust</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered Sweetener</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoons water as needed</li>  
    </ol>
    <h2>Peanut Butter Filling></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>7 ounces dairy-free cream cheese, softened (Violife or Kite Hill)</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut cream, room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered Sweetener</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoon coconut milk as needed</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Topping</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut cream</li>
        <li>1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon powdered Sweetener</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <h2>Chocolate Crust</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly grease a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie plate.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, and powdered sweetener. Stir in the melted coconut oil until the dough clumps together. If it won't hold together when you squeeze it in your hand, add a little water and mix well.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared baking pan, as evenly as possible. Freeze while preparing the filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Peanut Butter Filling</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese, coconut cream, and peanut butter until smooth. Beat in the sweetener and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Add the thinner coconut milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is light and fluffy, like mousse. Spread the mixture in the crust.</li>
        <li>Freeze until firm, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Topping</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chopped chocolate in a small bowl. Heat the coconut cream in a saucepan or in the microwave until bubbling, and pour over the chocolate.</li>
        <li>Let it a few minutes to melt, then add the sweetener and whisk until smooth. Drizzle over the chilled pie.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with chopped peanut butter cups, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
